This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been initialized.  This is common when dealing with asynchronous operations or when the component renders before the data it needs is available.  The error message may not explicitly mention 'undefined' but rather the consequence of attempting to operate on a value that is not yet defined, such as a TypeError or a crash.

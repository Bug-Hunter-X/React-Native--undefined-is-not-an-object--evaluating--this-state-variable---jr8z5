This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: accessing a state variable or prop before it has been initialized. The 'Bug.js' file shows the problematic code, resulting in an error when trying to use the state variable before it is set.  'BugSolution.js' provides a solution using the useEffect hook to ensure the state is initialized before use.  This problem frequently occurs with asynchronous data fetching or when data is not ready during initial render.
